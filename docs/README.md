# Welcome to Bsh!

Bsh is my second and (likely) final attempt at rewriting the [GTFO terminal](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Terminal). It introduces a ton of features incomparable to the mere command manipulation that [BashTerm](https://new.thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/food/BashTerm/) provides.

In many ways, Bsh is still a continuation of my original ideas when writing BashTerm: making the GTFO terminal easier to use, fun, and feel [more like a terminal](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

A lot a thought was put into designing the entire system to make a lot of the interesting features available. It was also a valuable learning experience for myself.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bsh is **100%** backwards compatible with Vanilla GTFO terminal usages!
{% endhint %}

When you install Bsh you can continue on with how you used to use the GTFO terminal, so there is no pressure in transitioning. When you do feel like it, you can explore additional features that Bsh provides! Or, if you want to jump straight it, continue to [onboarding.md](basics/onboarding.md "mention").

[^1]: I come from a unix-shell background, so when I discovered things like `clear` being unable to clear the screen, the whole terminal experience became rather detached.
